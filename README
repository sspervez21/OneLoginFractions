This repository contains a caluclator that operates on fractions. We only support the operators +,-,*,/.

Build instructions:
 - Install Go
 - go build Calc.go Fraction.go Main.go SignedCalc.go
 - This should create an executable that can be run on the commandline
 
Sample execution:
$ ./Calc.exe
? 1/3 + 2/3
= 1_0
? 1_1/3 + 2_1/3
= 3_2/3
? -1_1/3 + -2_1/3
= -3_2/3
? exit

Note that negative numbers are supported when in the correct syntax. Operatnds and operator must be separated by one or more spaces.

TODO:

  - Add support for whole numbers. Today, fractional components are required. We could make a simple modification to allow whole numbers only.
  - Add more tests. The existing code is about 75% test complete, additional tests are required for corner conditions such as divide-by-zero and zero fractione e.g. (0/0)
